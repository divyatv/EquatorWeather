Project: Web visualization of weather-plot analysis for cities around the equator.

Note to grader:
----------------------
1) The "Latitude" text in the landing page is mis-spelt in the homework screen shot- I have fixed that in my pages.
2) "Latitude" text in screen shot - has a seagreen background. I changed it after implementing seagreem backgroud color since I thought it looked better without the background color.
3) The Data page - has the data.csv rendered in html. I did use the datframe_to_html function but the output looked huge and ugly, I'm sorry. So I tried a bit of datframe styling and then used df.render() to generate a html file and used that.
