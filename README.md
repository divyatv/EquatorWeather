Project: Web visualization of weather-plot analysis for cities around the equator.

Note to grader:
----------------------
1) "Latitude" text in screen shot - has a seagreen background. I changed it after implementing seagream backgroud color,  since I thought it looked better without the background color.
2) The Data page - has the data.csv rendered in html. I did use the datframe_to_html function but I thought the output looked huge and cumberrsome, I'm sorry. So I tried a bit of datframe styling and then used df.render() to generate a html file and used that.Gave it aborder and some scrolling options.
