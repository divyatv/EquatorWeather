Project: Web visualization of weather-plot analysis for cities around the equator.

Note to grader:
----------------------
1. "Latitude" text in screen shot - has a seagreen background. I changed it after implementing seagreen background color, since I thought it looked better without the background color.

2. The Data page - has the data.csv rendered in html. I did use the datframe_to_html function but I thought the output looked huge and cumbersome, I'm sorry. So I tried a bit of dataframe styling and then used df.render() to generate a html file and used that.Gave it colored font and some scrolling options.

3.Deployed my repository in github pages and tested the pages on my iPhone. It looked good when I submitted it. Please let me know if it doesn't work while you grade.
